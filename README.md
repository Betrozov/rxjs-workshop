# RxJS - Level up 

#### This training will bring your RxJs skills to the next level! After a practical and detailed tour from creation to the destruction of streams  we will learn about multicasting, custom pipes and higher order observables.

## Description

This training will bring your RxJs skills to the next level!  

RxJs is more popular than ever. It is backed into the Angular core and also used in frameworks like React, Vue, and others!
This doesn't surprise as it leverages a powerful and elegant way to work with sync as well as async collections.

In this workshop, you will get a more complete understanding of this library. We will learn about the big and little things that make the difference in understanding!
After a practical and detailed tour from creation to the destruction of streams we will work on some concepts like multicasting, custom pipes and higher order observables.
Sounds interesting? Looking forward to meeting you at the workshop.
